# Batching Implementation Test

## Test the Sentence-Level Batching Feature

The batching implementation has been added to resolve LLM output truncation issues. Here's how to test it:

### Test Cases

1. **Short Text (≤3 sentences)**: Should be processed in a single batch
   - Example: "こんにちは。元気ですか？今日はいい天気ですね。"
   - Expected: Single API call, no batching

2. **Medium Text (4-6 sentences)**: Should be split into 2 batches
   - Example: "私は学生です。毎日学校に行きます。日本語を勉強しています。難しいですが楽しいです。先生はとても親切です。友達もたくさんいます。"
   - Expected: 2 API calls, results combined

3. **Long Text (7+ sentences)**: Should be split into multiple batches
   - Use longer Japanese text to test multiple batches

### How Batching Works

1. **Text Splitting**: Text is split into sentences using Japanese sentence endings (。！？…～♪♫)

2. **Batch Creation**: 
   - OpenAI/Gemini: 3 sentences per batch
   - OpenAI-format: 2 sentences per batch (more conservative due to stricter limits)

3. **Processing**: Each batch is processed separately with individual API calls

4. **Result Combination**: 
   - Sentences from all batches are combined
   - Words and grammar patterns are deduplicated
   - Translations are concatenated

### Console Logs to Watch For

When testing, check the browser console for logs like:
- "Split text into X sentences"
- "Created X batches" 
- "Processing batch X/Y with Z sentences"
- "Combined X batch results into final result"

### Error Handling

- If individual batches fail, processing continues with remaining batches
- Partial results are better than complete failures
- Fallback logic preserves as much data as possible

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the manga learning app
2. Use the text analysis feature with various lengths of Japanese text
3. Monitor browser console for batching logs
4. Verify that longer texts no longer cause JSON parsing errors
5. Check that sentence-level analysis is preserved across batches
