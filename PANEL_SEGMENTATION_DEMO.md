# Panel Segmentation Feature Demo

## Overview

The manga learning app now includes advanced panel segmentation capabilities that automatically:

1. **Detects manga panels** using computer vision
2. **Orders panels** following traditional manga reading sequence (right-to-left, top-to-bottom)  
3. **Analyzes each panel individually** for more accurate text extraction and translation
4. **Displays results** in both reading sequence and original layout views

## How It Works

### 1. Panel Detection Algorithm

The system uses classical computer vision techniques based on the ComicPanelSegmentation project:

- **Canny Edge Detection**: Identifies panel boundaries and borders
- **Probabilistic Hough Transform**: Detects straight lines that form panel borders
- **Line Merging**: Combines related line segments into complete panel boundaries
- **Filtering**: Removes noise and keeps only significant panel-dividing lines

### 2. Reading Order Detection

For manga pages, the algorithm automatically determines reading order:

- **Right-to-Left**: Within each row, panels are ordered from right to left
- **Top-to-Bottom**: Rows are processed from top to bottom
- **Automatic Numbering**: Each panel gets a sequence number for easy navigation

### 3. Individual Panel Analysis

Each detected panel is analyzed separately:

- **Text Extraction**: OCR on individual panels for better accuracy
- **Context Preservation**: Each panel maintains its position and reading order
- **Vocabulary Analysis**: Words and grammar patterns identified per panel
- **Translation**: Individual panel translations with context

## User Interface Features

### Panel View Modes

- **Reading Sequence**: Panels displayed in manga reading order
- **Original Layout**: Panels shown with position information

### Panel Information Display

- **Panel Number**: Original panel identifier
- **Reading Order**: Sequential position (#1, #2, etc.)
- **Dimensions**: Panel size and position coordinates
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback during segmentation process

### Enhanced Analysis Results

- **Panel-by-Panel Breakdown**: Individual analysis for each panel
- **Overall Summary**: Combined narrative understanding
- **Reading Order Guide**: Clear sequence indicators
- **Position Metadata**: Bounding box coordinates for each panel

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup_panel_segmentation.sh

# Or install manually
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
# Test dependencies
python3 -c "import numpy, cv2, PIL, skimage; print('OK')"

# Run comprehensive test
python3 test_panel_segmentation.py
```

### 3. Test Panel Segmentation API

```bash
# Test the segmentation endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/segment-panels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"imageBase64": "..."}'
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

- **`panel_segmentation.py`**: Core segmentation algorithm
- **`panel-segmentation-service.ts`**: TypeScript interface to Python
- **`/api/segment-panels`**: Dedicated API endpoint for testing
- **Enhanced `/api/analyze`**: Integrated segmentation + analysis

### Frontend Components

- **Enhanced `MangaAnalyzer`**: Displays segmented panels with reading order
- **Updated `ImageUploader`**: Shows segmentation progress
- **New UI Elements**: Panel position info, reading sequence indicators

### Data Flow

1. **Image Upload** → Base64 encoding
2. **Panel Segmentation** → Python script execution
3. **Panel Extraction** → Individual panel images
4. **AI Analysis** → Per-panel text analysis
5. **Result Compilation** → Combined analysis with reading order
6. **UI Rendering** → Enhanced display with panel information

## Error Handling

### Graceful Fallbacks

- **Segmentation Failure**: Falls back to full-image analysis
- **Missing Dependencies**: Clear error messages with setup instructions
- **Partial Failures**: Individual panel analysis errors don't break entire process

### Status Indicators

- **Segmentation Progress**: Real-time feedback during panel detection
- **Analysis Status**: Per-panel analysis progress
- **Error States**: Clear error messages and recovery suggestions

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features

- **Fast Algorithm**: Classical CV techniques are lightweight and fast
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple panels analyzed concurrently
- **Caching**: Results cached to avoid re-processing
- **Progressive Loading**: UI updates as panels are processed

### Limitations

- **Digital Images**: Works best with clean digital manga/comics
- **Clear Borders**: Requires distinct panel boundaries
- **Standard Layouts**: Optimized for traditional panel arrangements

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- **Deep Learning**: Alternative segmentation using neural networks
- **Speech Bubbles**: Separate detection and analysis of text bubbles
- **Character Recognition**: Identify and track characters across panels
- **Story Flow**: Enhanced narrative understanding across panels
- **Custom Reading Orders**: Support for non-standard layouts

### User Experience

- **Panel Editor**: Manual adjustment of detected panels
- **Layout Templates**: Predefined layouts for common manga styles
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple page analysis
- **Export Options**: Save segmented panels and analysis results
