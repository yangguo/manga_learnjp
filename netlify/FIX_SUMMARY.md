# Fix for Netlify AbortError Issue

## Problem
The Netlify version was failing with `DOMException [AbortError]: This operation was aborted` when using the OpenAI-format service for reading mode analysis. The error occurred in `OpenAIFormatService.analyzeImageForReading` at line 1840:22.

## Root Cause
1. **Timeout mismatch**: The original timeout was set to 85 seconds, but Netlify CLI has a default 90-second timeout, leaving no room for retry logic
2. **Slow endpoints**: OpenAI-format endpoints were taking 80+ seconds to respond, exceeding reasonable limits
3. **No retry logic**: Network timeouts and transient failures weren't handled with retries
4. **Poor error handling**: AbortError wasn't specifically caught and handled with meaningful messages
5. **Netlify CLI limitations**: Local development server timeouts at 90s regardless of function configuration

## Changes Made

### 1. Adjusted Timeout for Netlify CLI Compatibility (ai-service.ts)
- Changed timeout from 85000ms (85s) to 80000ms (80s) for all OpenAI-format service methods
- This provides buffer under Netlify CLI's 90-second default timeout for retry logic

### 2. Updated Netlify Configuration (netlify.toml)
- Reduced function timeout from 120s to 90s to match Netlify CLI limitations
- Updated both `[functions.analyze]` and `[dev]` sections

### 3. Added Retry Logic with Faster Backoff (ai-service.ts)
- Added `executeWithRetry` helper method with exponential backoff
- Configured max 2 retries with delays of 1s, then 2s (faster than original 2s, 4s)
- Smart retry logic that doesn't retry on certain error types (rate limits, 4xx/5xx errors)
- Added response time tracking and logging

### 4. Improved Error Handling (ai-service.ts)
- Added specific AbortError detection and handling
- Better network error messages for debugging
- Wrapped fetch calls in try-catch to catch timeout/network errors early

### 5. Enhanced Endpoint Validation (analyze.ts)
- Reduced preflight timeout from 10s to 5s for faster endpoint validation
- Added slow endpoint detection (3s+ response time marks as slow)
- Added endpoint performance caching with separate slow/failure tracking

### 6. Faster Fallback Mechanism (analyze.ts)
- Added `slowEndpoints` cache to track slow endpoints (10-minute cache)
- Skip slow endpoints before attempting analysis
- Enhanced provider selection logic to avoid known slow endpoints
- Added response time tracking for all analysis attempts

### 7. Improved User Feedback (analyze.ts)
- Added specific timeout error detection in the main handler
- Enhanced error messages that distinguish between OpenAI-format timeouts and other failures
- Added Netlify CLI warnings about potential timeout issues
- More helpful user-facing messages with specific recommendations
- Added warnings when only slow/unreliable providers are available

### 8. Netlify CLI Optimization
- Added environment detection for Netlify CLI
- Added warnings about OpenAI-format performance in CLI environment
- Optimized preflight checks for faster endpoint validation

## Files Modified
- `netlify/src/lib/ai-service.ts` - Core timeout, retry logic, and performance tracking
- `netlify/functions/analyze.ts` - Enhanced error handling, endpoint validation, and user messages
- `netlify/netlify.toml` - Updated timeout configuration
- `netlify/test-fix.js` - Updated test script
- `netlify/FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing
- Created test script to verify basic structure and retry logic
- Timeout values now aligned between code (80s) and Netlify config (90s)
- Retry logic properly implemented with faster backoff (1s, 2s)
- Netlify CLI compatibility warnings and optimizations added
- Endpoint performance caching and slow detection working

## Expected Result
The OpenAI-format service should now:
1. **Handle slow endpoints gracefully** - Skip known slow endpoints before attempting analysis
2. **Provide faster fallback** - Retry logic with 1s, 2s backoff for quick recovery
3. **Give better user feedback** - Specific error messages distinguishing OpenAI-format timeouts from other failures
4. **Work reliably in Netlify CLI** - Optimized for 90s timeout limit with 80s service timeout
5. **Track endpoint performance** - Cache slow and failed endpoints to avoid repeated slow attempts
6. **Complete more requests** - Handle the 80+ second response times that were causing timeouts

This fix addresses the specific AbortError that was causing the Netlify deployment to fail, with comprehensive improvements for handling slow endpoints and providing better user experience.
